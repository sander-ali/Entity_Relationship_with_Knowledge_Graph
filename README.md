# Entity_Relationship_with_Knowledge_Graph
The code in this repository provides a simple and basic implementation of Knowledge graphs by leveraging named entity recognition (NER) and entity relationships.

The relationships and recognition of name entitities are performed using pre-trained language models. 

The pre-trained language model extract informative facts using language representation while combining the knowledge, syntactic, and lexical knowledge. 

Following packages need to be installed before running the code

Spacy
networkx
rdflib
matplotlib

Make sure either you have downloaded en_core_web_sm or use python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

alternatively you can add 

import en_core_web_sm if the load command does not work. 

A sample result is shown below:
